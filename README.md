## Introduction

**WebDocs** is a personal portfolio website created using **VitePress**. It is designed in a clean, documentation-like style, inspired by Wikipedia and technical documentation. This website serves as a hub for showcasing my projects, study materials, and professional work in an organized and accessible manner.

The website features a sidebar for easy navigation between different sections (e.g., projects, learning topics), a main content area for detailed articles, and a table of contents on the right side for quick access to page headings.

## Features

- **Documentation-Style Layout**: A clean and organized look similar to technical documentation or wiki pages.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for viewing on all devices, including mobile and tablets.
- **Easy Navigation**: Sidebar for projects and studies, with a table of contents for easy heading navigation.
- **Markdown-Based Content**: Easily add and update content using Markdown (`.md`) files.
- **Customization**: Built with VitePress, which allows for fast and lightweight performance with customization options.
